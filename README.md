**Stock Market Pipeline**

**Project Overview**

This project builds an end-to-end Stock Market Data Pipeline using Apache Airflow for scheduling, Apache Spark for data transformations, and PostgreSQL for storage. The transformed data is then visualized using Metastore, providing valuable insights into stock market trends.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Core programming language for data processing and pipeline orchestration.
PySpark: Used for efficient large-scale data transformations.
Docker: Containerizes Apache Spark for scalable and reproducible data transformations.
PostgreSQL: Stores processed stock market data for further analysis.
Metastore: Provides visualization capabilities for analyzing stock market trends.
Apache Airflow: Schedules and manages ETL workflows.

**Project Workflow**

**Data Extraction:**

Fetches stock market data from external sources (APIs, CSV, or databases).
**Data Transformation (ETL):**
Cleanses and processes raw stock data using PySpark.
Formats and optimizes data for storage and analysis.
**Data Loading:**
Stores transformed data in PostgreSQL for structured querying.
**Visualization:**
Uses Metastore to create dashboards and track stock performance.
